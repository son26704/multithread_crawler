Here’s what’s rumored so far ahead of its September debut. If you’ve skipped the iPhone 16 or are holding out for more compelling upgrades  here are 17 rumored features that could make the iPhone 17 lineup  launching this September  worth the wait. A model of the iPhone 17 Air highlights its ultra-thin design. Photo: Majin Bu Apple is expected to introduce a brand-new model with a significantly thinner design  possibly called iPhone 17 Air. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo  it will sport a completely reimagined form with a single rear camera embedded in a horizontal strip at the top  paired with a more compact Dynamic Island. The iPhone 17 Air is said to be just 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point  featuring a 6.6-inch display  aluminum frame  A19 chip  Apple C1 modem  Action button  dedicated camera control button  and a 24MP front-facing camera. This model may eventually replace the iPhone Plus series. 2. All-new aluminum design Apple is rumored to bring aluminum frames back to the entire iPhone 17 lineup. The two iPhone 17 Pro models would be the first premium variants to feature aluminum frames since Apple began differentiating Pro and non-Pro models. Previously  aluminum was limited to the iPhone SE and mid-range models. While the iPhone 15 Pro switched to titanium  the iPhone 17 is expected to use aluminum across all versions. 3. Redesigned rear camera array A real-world iPhone 17 Pro prototype spotted. Photo: @kdctweets The iPhone 17 Pro models will likely see a major shift in rear camera design. Apple plans to abandon the familiar square bump in favor of a horizontal aluminum camera bar across the top half of the phone. The upper half of the back will be aluminum  housing the camera system  while the lower half remains glass for wireless charging support. Camera modules will match the color of the chassis and appear larger than on current models. While the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max already increased in display size  Apple is reportedly bringing a 6.27-inch screen to the standard iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 Air will debut with a completely new size  distinguishing it from previous Plus models. 5. ProMotion 120Hz and always-on display Apple intends to bring ProMotion 120Hz refresh rates to the entire iPhone 17 series  enhancing scrolling and video playback. More importantly  this technology allows screens to reduce refresh rates to 1Hz  enabling an always-on display for clocks  widgets  notifications  and wallpapers on the lock screen. 6. Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip Premium iPhone 17 models will be equipped with Apple’s in-house Wi-Fi 7 chip  which supports simultaneous transmission across 2.4GHz  5GHz  and 6GHz bands. This will deliver faster speeds  lower latency  and more reliable connectivity. 7. 48MP telephoto lens Thickness comparison between the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 16e. Photo: Majin Bu The iPhone 17 Pro is rumored to feature a 48MP telephoto lens tailored for use with Vision Pro. It will support a 3.5x optical zoom (85mm focal length) instead of the current 5x  optimizing it for portrait and casual photography. The higher resolution enables better digital cropping without significant quality loss. 8. 8K video recording While Apple tested 8K video on the iPhone 16 Pro  the feature is expected to debut on the iPhone 17 Pro  leveraging the new 48MP lens. This positions Apple to compete directly with Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra and Google’s Pixel 9 Pro. 9. 24MP front-facing camera A new 24MP selfie camera with a 6-element lens is rumored  replacing the current 12MP  5-element configuration. This upgrade will deliver sharper self-portraits with improved detail  even when cropped or zoomed. 10. More durable  anti-reflective display The iPhone 17 display is expected to feature a tougher  anti-reflective coating that surpasses Ceramic Shield in scratch resistance. While it’s unclear if Apple will use Gorilla Glass Armor (as seen on the Galaxy S24 Ultra)  this enhancement should improve durability significantly. At least one iPhone 17 model will reportedly include 12GB of RAM. Analyst Jeff Pu expects both Pro models to feature the upgrade  while Ming-Chi Kuo believes it will be exclusive to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. More RAM will support advanced multitasking and AI functions under Apple Intelligence. 12. Smaller Dynamic Island The iPhone 17 Pro Max may have a smaller Dynamic Island thanks to "metalens" technology - a new ultra-thin lens used for Face ID. This would mark the first significant change to Dynamic Island since its introduction on the iPhone 14 Pro. The iPhone 17 series will run on Apple’s A19 chip  likely built on TSMC’s upgraded N3P (3nm) process. The Pro models will use the A19 Pro  while the standard and Air versions get the regular A19. The new chip promises performance gains and better energy efficiency. 14. Custom Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip Apple is replacing Broadcom’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips with its own in-house solution. This gives Apple greater control over hardware integration and enables Wi-Fi 7 support across all four iPhone 17 models. 15. New vapor chamber cooling All iPhone 17 variants are expected to adopt vapor chamber cooling - a technology already used in many high-end Android phones. This allows better heat dissipation and maintains stable performance  especially on thinner devices. 16. Reverse wireless charging Apple is testing 7.5W reverse wireless charging on the iPhone 17 Pro. This feature would allow users to wirelessly charge accessories such as AirPods  Apple Watch  or MagSafe battery packs  similar to existing Android flagships. The iPhone 17 Pro Max will be slightly thicker (8.725mm compared to 8.25mm)  which likely indicates a bigger battery. This would provide longer usage times - an important improvement for power users. Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhone lineup in September. The 2025 models will reportedly include the iPhone 17  iPhone 17 Pro  iPhone 17 Pro Max  and the ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air  all featuring substantial upgrades  particularly in the Pro range.
