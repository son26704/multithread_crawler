Every year  several high schools in Ho Chi Minh City set sky-high entrance scores for grade 10  requiring students to score at least 8 points per subject to be admitted. In reality  even academically strong students find it difficult to secure a spot at these institutions. According to the principal of one high school  this phenomenon is partly due to Nguyen Thuong Hien being one of the regular schools previously allowed to admit students to specialized classes  alongside elite schools like Le Hong Phong and Tran Dai Nghia. Being included in the first admission round gave it an edge that other regular schools did not have. Another reason is population density - Tan Binh  Tan Phu  and Binh Tan districts are highly populated  yet public high schools are fewer compared to other areas. Tan Binh District  for instance  has only three public high schools: Nguyen Thuong Hien  Nguyen Thai Binh  and Nguyen Chi Thanh. Meanwhile  Tan Phu has schools like Tan Binh  Tay Thanh  Tran Phu  and Le Trong Tan. Due to the scarcity of options  many students choose to apply to Nguyen Thuong Hien  pushing its admission scores even higher - especially since it participated in early rounds of enrollment. In Binh Tan District  which is one of the cityâ€™s most populous areas  public schools include Vinh Loc  Nguyen Huu Canh  Binh Hung Hoa  Binh Tan  and An Lac. This year  the district proposed adding nearly 700 additional grade 10 slots for Binh Tri Dong B High School. Starting in 2025  Nguyen Thuong Hien  along with three other regular high schools - Gia Dinh  Nguyen Huu Huan  and Mac Dinh Chi - will discontinue their specialized class admissions. Other high schools known for their exceptionally high entry scores include Nguyen Thi Minh Khai  Le Quy Don  and Bui Thi Xuan  thanks to their long-standing academic reputations and central locations in Districts 1 and 3. Gia Dinh High School (Binh Thanh District) attracts students not only from within the district but also from neighboring areas. Nguyen Huu Huan High School (Thu Duc City) is considered the best high school in the area  home to more than 1.2 million residents. Elsewhere  each district has a focal school of interest: Nguyen Huu Cau High School (Hoc Mon District) draws students from both Hoc Mon and District 12. Other popular schools include Phu Nhuan High School (Phu Nhuan District)  Mac Dinh Chi (District 6)  the High School of Education Practice - HCMC University of Education (District 5)  and Tran Phu High School (Tan Phu District). Below is the list of the top 10 high schools with the highest annual grade 10 admission scores in Ho Chi Minh City: Conversely  several high schools in Ho Chi Minh City have much lower entry scores  particularly in the outlying districts of Binh Chanh  Nha Be  Cu Chi  and Can Gio. Students only need to score about 3 to 4 points per subject to gain admission at schools such as Duong Van Duong  An Nhon Tay  Quang Trung  An Nghia  Can Thanh  Binh Khanh  Da Phuoc  and Phong Phu.
