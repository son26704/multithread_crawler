Tran Nam Thai  a student at the Olympia Schools in Hanoi  has recently gained admission to seven US universities  all ranked in the top 100. Notably  Fordham University awarded him a scholarship of over $200 000 (roughly VND5 billion). “Fordham is my choice because I believe its program will sharpen my financial thinking. Plus  being in New York City  the global finance center  will let me connect with industry experts ” Thai said. Inspired by his father’s business stories and practical lessons on financial management  Thai decided very early that he would follow finance-related training majors. In 10th grade  he began researching the US universities strong in finance and built a roadmap of academics and extracurriculars to strengthen his application. Rather than showing a profile with high grades and a series of extracurricular activities  Thai wanted to show dedication to his passion with a clear direction. Most of his activities centered on business and finance. In 2024  guided by a lecturer from Thai Binh University  Thai joined a study on “applying the circular economy model to macadamia and avocado production to boost financial efficiency in agriculture.” He helped survey nearly 170 cooperatives to assess the model’s financial impact. The research group then proposed ways to optimize resource use  cut costs  and increase value. It was later published in the International Journal of Agriculture and Biosciences. Thai also founded “FinAgri ” a project to help farmers in Moc Chau  Son La improve business outcomes. Through workshops on economic investment and business development  the project helped farmers attract funding  boosting profits by nearly 10 percent compared to the previous season. While working with locals and touring the PaKhen avocado orchard  Thai launched a startup selling Moc Chau avocados. Over two summers  his team sold 650 kilograms of avocado  earning over VND30 million. All the money was donated to buy books and clothes for PaKhen Primary School students. Driven by his passion for business and finance  Thai became an active leader in a high school finance club and helped organize a business and entrepreneurship competition for 16- to 18-year-olds. “I didn’t list countless activities. I focused on what I poured time and heart into—things that helped me grow and taught me valuable lessons ” Thai said. For his essay  Thai wrote about playing Quasimodo in the musical The Hunchback of Notre Dame. “At first  it was just a challenge  but the role forced me to face my insecurities and tendency to overcontrol in group work. I learned to trust  listen  and accept my own and others’ ‘imperfections.’ I used Quasimodo—‘flawed but sincere’—to show my growth in leadership  empathy  and perseverance.” Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Fri Apr 18 06:04:00 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
