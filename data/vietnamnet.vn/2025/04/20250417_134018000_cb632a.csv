Health risks of counterfeit medication According to Associate Professor Nguyen Hoai Nam  senior lecturer at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City  patients who consume counterfeit drugs face numerous health risks. Fully fake medications  such as pills made from flour  offer no therapeutic benefit. Partially fake drugs  with incorrect dosages or ingredients  not only fail to treat the condition but can also cause harmful side effects. He particularly warned against bone and joint medications adulterated with high doses of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids like Dexamethasone or Cortisone. While these drugs may temporarily relieve symptoms  they can lead to dependency  prompting patients to take them at every sign of pain. Nam stressed that corticosteroids must only be used under strict medical supervision. Prolonged unsupervised use can result in severe consequences such as osteoporosis  hypertension  blood clots  gastric ulcers  immune suppression  and even adrenal gland atrophy  where the body stops producing natural hormones due to dependence on external drugs. He also noted that high doses of corticosteroids can disrupt lipid metabolism  causing fat accumulation in the face  neck  and back  leading to Cushing’s syndrome. Associate Professor and pharmacist Nguyen Huu Duc  former lecturer at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City  added that counterfeit drugs may contain no active ingredients  incorrect dosages  impure or contaminated compounds  or even toxic substances. These pose life-threatening risks  leaving illnesses untreated and potentially worsening the patient’s condition. Both experts strongly advised consumers to buy medications only from certified pharmacies that meet Good Pharmacy Practice (GPP) standards and to avoid unregulated or hand-sold drugs. Inside the massive fake drug operation Police in Thanh Hoa also arrested 14 individuals involved in producing and distributing counterfeit drugs intended for disease prevention and treatment. According to investigators  the suspects operated a widespread operation across cities including Hanoi  Ho Chi Minh City  Vinh Phuc  Hung Yen  An Giang  and Dong Thap. They raided six production and storage facilities  seizing nearly 10 tons of fake Western medicines and raw materials. The ringleaders  Nguyen Tien Dat (born 1991  residing at Hapulico Apartment Complex  Thanh Xuan District  Hanoi) and Trinh Doan Giao (born 1985  residing in Binh Tan District  Ho Chi Minh City)  coordinated the operation by exploiting regulatory gaps in pharmaceutical sales. They purchased unverified pharmaceutical ingredients  herbs  and medicinal powders of unknown origin. Workers were hired to mix and grind the materials into powder  encapsulate them using machines  blister-pack the capsules  and package them under branded labels for distribution. To mislead consumers  the group did not replicate existing legitimate medications. Instead  they created entirely new drug names and fictitious foreign company identities  often claiming origins in Hong Kong  Malaysia  or Singapore. This tactic confused buyers into believing they were purchasing imported supplements. Initially  the group mixed genuine medicine into batches of fake products to evade detection during inspections. Once they built a stable customer base  they sold only their self-manufactured counterfeit drugs  primarily targeting freelance pharmacists operating in medicine markets. From 2021 until their arrest  the group circulated large volumes of counterfeit medications nationwide  earning illicit profits estimated at nearly 200 billion VND.
