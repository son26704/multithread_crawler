The Australian writer showered praise on the street food that he savored during his bruef stay in HCM City  Vietnam’s vibrant hub  before boarding a Mekong River cruise to Phnom Penh in Cambodia. Ben arrived in HCM City at night and after checking into his hotel  took a walk on the bustling sidewalks to Co Lieng eatery in District 3  a Michelin-recommended spot. Co Lieng  located on Vo Van Tan street since 1995  offers a 14-item menu  including bo nuong la lot (grilled beef in lolot leaf) or ‘beef in a leaf’  bo nuong mo chai (Grilled Beef in Caul Fat)  banh hoi nem nuong (Grilled Pork Crepe Noodles)  cha dum mo chai (Vietnamese Steaming Meatballs)  ca loc nuong (Grilled Snakehead Fish)  and bun thit nuong (Vietnamese barbecue pork with vermicelli). A serving of beef in betel leaves costs VND80 000  nearly double the city’s average. Ben said the “classic  no-frills Saigon eatery” had a charcoal grill  a glass display case outside  and simple tables in a cramped space. “The specialty is beef in lolot leaves with minced  seasoned beef  wrapped in leaves  grilled  and served with herbs  pickled veggies  and thin rice paper ” he wrote. He noted the dish’s sweet  sour  salty flavors and smoky aroma—a perfect start to his Vietnamese food journey. Next  Ben stopped by Banh Mi Huynh Hoa  a famed HCM City sandwich shop packed with international tourists. He ordered a baguette stuffed with pate  mayonnaise  smoked pork slices  pickled daikon  carrots  and the shop’s signature shredded dried pork. He called the sandwich an “umami bomb”. The next morning at 6  Ben strolled to nearby cafe TrungNguyen Legend for iced milk coffee  and later returned to his hotel for a breakfast buffet  enjoying a bowl of steamed beef pho. Hours later  he visited a lively bun rieu (Crab noodle soup) stall on Nguyen Canh Chan street. He noted that it was “not for the faint of heart”: a broth of tomato and freshwater crab  with pork  pig’s trotters  sliced banana blossom  herbs  rice noodles  and a chunk of blood pudding atop. That evening  he dined on banh canh cua (crab thick rice noodle soup) at Banh Canh Cua 87 in District 1. For his final breakfast before leaving HCM City  he chose the eatery Phu Vuong Pho  which he described as “not exactly Ho Chi Minh City’s most basic purveyor of noodle soup  but certainly not its fanciest. The tables are made of thin sheet metal  the seats plastic  the service brusque. And the soup is astonishly  transcendentally good.” “I know pho. I love pho. And this pho is the best I’ve ever had ” he said  adding that of all his meals during his short visit  “it’s the pho that will stay with me forever  the one I will always be chasing. Breakfast will never be the same.” foreigners in vietnam Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Fri Apr 18 05:03:00 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
