The Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information is coordinating with relevant agencies to investigate and take action against celebrities involved in misleading advertising of food supplements and products  sparking concerns over false claims and consumer deception. Actor Doan Quoc Dam clarified his involvement in a controversial milk advertisement on April 16. On the morning of April 17  Deputy Director Nguyen Thi Thanh Huyen of the Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information confirmed to Tri Thuc – Znews that the agency had received a formal request from the Ministry of Health to investigate and address legal violations by public figures promoting products with exaggerated or unverified claims. “The Authority is currently conducting verification and will provide official information once results are available ” she stated. At a recent Government press conference  Standing Deputy Minister of Culture  Sports and Tourism Le Hai Binh revealed that the ministry is working to revise the Law on Advertising  particularly to address emerging realities in the digital landscape. “We’ve received many heartfelt and practical suggestions during the amendment process ” he said. “The revised law will likely include specific provisions regarding celebrity endorsements. Notably  those who advertise online will be legally accountable for the claims they make  including the requirement for verified and transparent product information.” He added that accompanying decrees are expected to establish clear regulations on the conduct of celebrities and influencers promoting products online. These may include stricter penalties such as fines  advertising bans  or even restrictions on artistic performances and public appearances on traditional and social media. Public backlash over misleading celebrity endorsements The controversy erupted after actors Doan Quoc Dam and MC Hoang Linh appeared in promotional videos for Cilonmum  a product now linked to a massive fake milk scandal involving 573 counterfeit brands. In the video  Doan Quoc Dam endorsed Cilonmum Colos IQ Grow 24h  while Hoang Linh claimed she was satisfied with finally finding the right milk for her child. Doan Quoc Dam issued a statement on the evening of April 16 to clarify his involvement in the advertisement. Other public figures such as Quang Minh  Van Hugo  Thanh Huong  Quyen Linh  and Hong Van have also come under scrutiny for previously promoting various milk products - though not all of these are tied to the counterfeit case. On April 15  BTV Quang Minh publicly apologized and accepted responsibility. Meanwhile  MC Quyen Linh posted several clarifications  affirming that he never promoted fake milk. On April 15  the Department of Food Safety under the Ministry of Health issued an official document requesting coordination from the Broadcasting Authority and the Department of Grassroots Culture to monitor and manage advertising practices. The directive calls for an investigation into social media advertisements - especially those involving celebrities - and demands a report on enforcement outcomes. advertising violations Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Thu Apr 17 15:51:20 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
