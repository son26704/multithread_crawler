After much deliberation over whether to sell the gold he had been holding since early 2020  Nguyen Thanh Chung  a resident of Dong Da District in Hanoi  finally sold all of it at 115.5 million VND ($4 540) per tael on the morning of April 17. Chung shared that at the end of 2019  he had plans to buy an apartment. At the time  he had saved 1.5 billion VND ($59 000) and intended to take out a loan for the remaining amount. But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020  his job and income were impacted  forcing him to postpone the purchase. Instead  he used his 1.5 billion VND to buy 31 taels of SJC gold. After the pandemic  his work stabilized again - but apartment prices had skyrocketed. That meant taking out an even larger loan if he wanted to proceed. The plan was again put on hold  and the gold remained untouched in his safe. Recently  with gold prices soaring and real estate showing no signs of cooling  he decided to sell the gold and combine it with his savings to finally buy a home. "By selling all 31 taels of gold  I earned 3.58 billion VND ($141 000). That’s over 2 billion VND ($78 500) in profit compared to when I bought it " Chung said. In contrast  Bui Thi Thu Ha and her husband found themselves scrambling to buy gold to repay a long-standing debt. “Exactly nine years ago  I borrowed eight taels of gold to buy a house. I sold it then for about 37 million VND ($1 455) per tael ” she recalled. At the time  her family simply said  “Return it whenever they ask.” In late 2019  her father gave her money to buy five taels of SJC gold as wedding gifts for his future grandchildren. Seeing that gold prices were relatively stable  she invested the money in her business instead. But in mid-February this year  when her first niece got married  her father asked about the gold. She and her husband panicked and rushed to buy it back at 90 million VND ($3 540) per tael. After days of queuing  they managed to purchase five taels for about 400 million VND ($15 700) - much more than the original price of around 48 million VND ($1 890) per tael. “After buying those five taels  we told each other we’d wait for prices to drop before buying the remaining eight taels to repay the debt ” Ha said. However  the more they waited  the higher prices soared. Anxious  they took time off work and queued again  this time paying 118 million VND ($4 640) per tael. So  how has gold fluctuated over the past decade  from 2016 to 2025? After a gold fever during 2009-2011  prices plunged and hit a low of 32.45 million VND ($1 275) per tael in late 2015. By April 11  2016  gold sold by Saigon Jewelry Company (SJC) had risen to 33.3 million VND ($1 310) per tael - an increase of 850 000 VND ($33) from the previous year’s close  but still down 1.91 million VND ($75) from April 17  2015. On April 17  2017  SJC’s gold price jumped to 37.25 million VND ($1 470) per tael - up 3.95 million VND ($156) from the same day in 2016. But during the same period in 2018 and 2019  prices dipped to 37.07 million VND ($1 462) and 36.39 million VND ($1 435) per tael  respectively. Shortly thereafter  gold entered a period of extreme volatility  breaking record after record. From 2021 to 2022  gold maintained a steady upward trend. On April 17  2021  the price stood at 55.47 million VND ($2 180) per tael. One year later  on April 17  2022  it surged to 69.87 million VND ($2 740). On April 17  2023  the price dipped by 2.65 million VND ($105) from the previous year to 67.22 million VND ($2 640). Yet  within just one more year  by April 17  2024  gold skyrocketed again to 84.1 million VND ($3 310) per tael - an increase of 16.88 million VND ($665). Over the past year  gold has been on a wild ride  with sharp spikes followed by steep drops  sometimes losing several million VND per tael in a single trading session. Supply has grown scarce. People and investors routinely line up at gold shops to make purchases. Major brands have struggled to keep up  often imposing strict limits on the amount each customer can buy. On online marketplaces and sidewalks  gold trading remains brisk  with prices often 1 to 3 million VND ($40 to $120) higher per tael than those listed by official dealers. At the close of trading on April 17  gold reached a new all-time high. SJC listed prices at 115.5 million VND ($4 540) to buy and 118 million VND ($4 640) to sell - up 2.5 million VND ($98) from the previous day. Compared to April 11  2016  gold has jumped 84.7 million VND ($3 340) per tael. In just one year  from April 17  2023 to 2024  it has risen by 33.9 million VND ($1 335). Anyone who bought gold on April 11  2016 and sold it on April 17  2025 would have earned 82.2 million VND ($3 240) per tael. Those who bought it just one year ago would have gained 31.4 million VND ($1 240) per tael. vietnam's gold market Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Fri Apr 18 10:55:30 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
