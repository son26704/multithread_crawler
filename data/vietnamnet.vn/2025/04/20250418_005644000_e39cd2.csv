On the evening of April 17  rescue teams recovered the body of a male tourist who had fallen into a deep ravine at Son Tra Peninsula in Da Nang  Vietnam. The body was brought to the surface to facilitate an official investigation. Earlier that same afternoon  while patrolling the Son Tra Peninsula  authorities discovered a motorbike that had been abandoned for several days near the Bai Bac area. Upon inspection  identification documents belonging to a foreign tourist were found inside  raising suspicions of a possible accident. Local forces including the military  civil defense  police  and the Fire Prevention  Fighting and Rescue Police Department of Da Nang promptly launched a coordinated search operation. However  the search was significantly hampered by the area’s treacherous terrain  which included steep cliffs and vertical rock walls  making access to the site extremely difficult. Rescue teams equipped themselves with a specialized pulley system  safety harnesses  and machetes to clear dense undergrowth while descending into the ravine. After enduring hazardous conditions and navigating steep and rocky slopes  rescuers eventually reached the location of the male victim’s body at the base of the ravine. Using the pulley system  the body was successfully retrieved and brought to the surface. The scene was immediately secured for investigation purposes. Forensic and investigative units arrived on-site to conduct necessary procedures in accordance with regulations.
