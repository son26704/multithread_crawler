Tuan Cry (real name Nguyen Sy Tuan)  was born in 1992 in Yen Phong  Bac Ninh. Losing his father before birth  Tuan grew up with his maternal grandparents as his mother worked far away to support his education. She never remarried  focusing solely on raising him. Despite lacking affection  his childhood brimmed with resilience. Young Tuan learned independence early  herding cows and catching crabs. His passion for music sparked at 8 or 9. At that time  he often sang at weddings. After high school  with no guidance  he scoured the internet and applied to the University of Theater and Cinema in Hanoi but failed the entrance exam. He then enrolled in electronics at Hanoi University of Industry  a pretext for him to go and live in the capital city. "I barely focused on studies  mostly spending time on dancing hip-hop  singing at cafes  and performing for school clubs " Tuan recalled. Later  realizing that singing couldn’t sustain him  he returned home and took manual jobs like hauling goods and driving trucks. Grandfather’s threat In 2018  a chance moment changed Tuan’s life. After a grueling workday  he livestreamed on Facebook  singing "Nguoi la oi” (Stranger  Please) in a distinct northern accent. Unexpectedly  the clip went viral. Seizing the opportunity  Tuan sold his truck  built a house for his mother  and moved to Hanoi to pursue music. The decision faced strong opposition from his grandfather. Unable to talk face to face  Tuan wrote a letter to him: "I want to chase my passion and explore the world. I don’t want a repetitive life." Tuan Cry’s music journey wasn’t smooth—he returned home multiple times after setbacks. However  this gave him the opportunity to learn more about quan ho folk music and Kinh Bac culture. He realized that the "treasure" he sought was right in his hometown. Tuan Cry gradually made his mark with contemporary folk music hits like "Moi Trau " "Ken Ca Chon Canh " and especially "Bac Bling"—a project hitting 100 million views  topping social media platforms for days. "Bac Bling dared to introduce local material  showcasing Bac Ninh’s quan ho beauty  loved by many. It reflects national identity. Young people  elders  and friends from other provinces feel proud. International peers praised it " he said. Bac Bling introduces local material  showcasing Bac Ninh’s quan ho beauty  loved by many. It reflects national identity. Success transformed Tuan’s life  from packed schedules to public recognition. "After Bac Bling  work piled up  and I lost 3 kilos " he admitted. At 33  he said: "I’m calmer now. Rise without pride  fall without fear. Even if I stumble  I’m used to it. I’ll bounce back fast."
