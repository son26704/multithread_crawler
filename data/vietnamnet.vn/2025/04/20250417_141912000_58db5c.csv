The ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) officially announced on the morning of April 17 that Indonesia will host the 2025 AFF U23 Championship. Vietnam is the reigning champion of the tournament. Initially  AFF had planned for Thailand to host the regional U23 event scheduled for August 2025. However  in its final decision  AFF confirmed that the tournament will be held in Indonesia. This will mark the first time since 2005 that the archipelago nation officially hosts the U23 Southeast Asian football championship. According to the AFF's schedule  the tournament will take place from July 15 to July 31  2025. After four editions of the tournament  Vietnam is the most successful team  having won back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023. In recent years  the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) and head coach Kim Sang Sik have prioritized youth development  allowing promising young players to gain valuable international experience - and in some cases  even make appearances for the senior national team. With no other major tournaments overlapping  it is likely that Coach Kim Sang Sik will personally lead the U23 Vietnam team in its quest to defend the title at the upcoming AFF U23 Championship.
