Tucked away inside Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens in District 1  Ho Chi Minh City  the Nhan Huong café once operated as a covert base for the Saigon Special Forces during the resistance war against the United States. Disguised as a simple refreshment stand  it sheltered and supported military officers  intelligence agents  and guerrilla fighters for over a decade. Established in 1963  the café played a crucial role during the war  collecting intelligence and relaying it to the revolutionary command  all under the unassuming façade of a drinks shop. The base was carefully disguised to avoid suspicion and operated right under the noses of American and South Vietnamese military personnel. Spanning around 100 square meters  the café’s interior remains much as it was half a century ago. Life-sized mannequins of soldiers  civilians  and waitstaff recreate the once-bustling atmosphere. To ensure secrecy and safety  Mr. Tung staffed the café only with trusted family members. Despite welcoming numerous military personnel and government officials from the US-backed Saigon regime  the café never aroused suspicion. From 1963 until the fall of Saigon in 1975  Nhan Huong café served as a haven for key military officers  commandos  and intelligence agents  providing a safe house for both shelter and strategic coordination. Mr. Tung gathered  reviewed  and relayed sensitive information to the resistance  enabling timely countermeasures. In addition to sheltering personnel  the café also contributed financially to revolutionary operations. Today  visitors can explore the space to learn about the historical operations of the Saigon Special Forces and experience the lifestyle and cuisine of the city’s past through original furniture and recreated scenes. Saigon Zoo was strategically selected for this covert base in 1963. As a popular public attraction  it allowed resistance fighters to enter and exit unnoticed. Its central location  close to the administrative core of the South Vietnamese regime  made it an ideal site for directing commando operations. In 2014  the café was recognized as a municipal historical monument. It is now open to the public free of charge on weekends and national holidays.
