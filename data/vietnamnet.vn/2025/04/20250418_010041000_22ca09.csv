The government has agreed to submit a revised proposal to the relevant authorities confirming that Vietnam will have only one international financial center (IFC)  governed by a single policy framework and located in both Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang. Minister of Finance Nguyen Van Thang.

Presenting the government's summary report  Minister of Finance Nguyen Van Thang emphasized that  based on political  legal  and practical grounds both domestically and internationally  it is essential for the National Assembly to issue a resolution on developing an international financial center in Vietnam. The draft resolution comprises six chapters and 36 articles  detailing administrative procedures necessary for implementing special mechanisms and policies to operate and develop the IFC. These administrative procedures are designed to be simplified to facilitate maximum ease for organizations and individuals involved in the IFC's development. One center  two cities Le Thi Nga  Standing Vice Chairwoman of the Committee on People’s Aspirations and Oversight  commented  “This is a highly complex and new area for Vietnam. Financial matters are extremely sensitive  so we recommend thoroughly evaluating potential impacts on the economy  national security  defense  public order  and social safety.” Minister Nguyen Van Thang noted that there are approximately 121 financial centers globally  but fewer than 10 have achieved notable success. Earlier this year  the Politburo approved the establishment of a comprehensive international financial center in Ho Chi Minh City and a regional financial center in Da Nang. However  after reviewing international models and conducting domestic surveys  the Ministry of Finance concluded that developing two separate financial centers of differing scales in two cities may prove inefficient and less likely to succeed  especially given that this model is entirely new to Vietnam. Therefore  the government has decided to present a unified proposal to higher authorities  determining that Vietnam will have only one international financial center with a single policy framework  located in both Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang. Specifically  Ho Chi Minh City will focus on developing capital markets  international banking  financial services  and regional value chains. Meanwhile  Da Nang will specialize in green finance  fintech  and regional fund management  connected to a free trade zone in the city. “However  this division is only relative. Ultimately  the decision lies with investors ” Minister Thang noted. Permanent Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Hoa Binh emphasized that Vietnam’s current economic scale is modest. Simultaneously building both an international and a regional financial center in two different cities would not align with reality and would be unsustainable. Thus  the decision to develop one international financial center with functions distributed across two cities  tailored to their respective strengths  is more practical and ensures these cities grow without competing with each other. Concluding the session  National Assembly Vice Chairman Vu Hong Thanh acknowledged that developing an international financial center in Vietnam is both “new and difficult.” He recommended that the drafting committee continue coordinating efforts  clarifying the policy groups outlined in the draft resolution  and addressing concerns regarding the dual-city model  including the coordination mechanism and the operational independence of the managing agency for the two locations. financial centers in vietnam national assembly news Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Fri Apr 18 01:00:41 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
