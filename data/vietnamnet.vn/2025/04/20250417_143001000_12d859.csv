Experts urge early detection and strict penalties from authorities. At the third meeting of the 10th Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front (VFF) on April 17  many delegates expressed concern about lax oversight of food safety and counterfeit goods following the recent discovery of nearly 600 counterfeit milk products. “Five ministries managing one dinner table” must stop Nguyen Thi Doan  former Vice President and a current member of the VFF Presidium  called for accountability: “We need to identify which agency is responsible for incidents like this. We cannot continue with a system where 'five ministries manage one dinner table.’” She criticized the lack of clarity in responsibility  pointing out  “The Ministry of Industry and Trade says it’s not within their purview - so who oversees the nearly 600 fake milk products? Who ensures that the skewers sold for 5 000–10 000 VND outside school gates are safe or not? This is a pressing issue and needs resolution.” This sentiment was echoed by Professor Dr. Tran Ngoc Duong  Chairman of the VFF’s Advisory Council on Democracy and Law. “These products claimed to contain bird’s nest extract  cordyceps  macadamia powder  and walnut powder  but in reality  they had none of these ingredients. Shockingly  well-known showbiz figures helped promote these fake items  with widespread advertising campaigns that fooled the public for four years ” he said. Call for stronger crackdown on counterfeit goods Bui Thi Thanh  former Vice President of the Central Committee of the VFF  also raised concerns over the widespread sale of fake milk and pharmaceuticals  which seriously affect public health. She added that rising gold prices  online scams  and fake products were increasingly alarming issues that required urgent action. Thanh proposed that the VFF recommend to the Party and Government stronger measures to stabilize gold prices and reinforce penalties for cybercrime and the production and sale of counterfeit or substandard goods. Proposal to reduce tuition fees for non-public school students Dr. Nguyen Van Pha  former Vice Chairman of the National Assembly’s Judicial Committee  proposed reducing tuition fees for students at non-public schools to match the reductions given to public school students  arguing that private school enrollment now represents a significant portion of the student population. A voter from Hai Ba Trung District echoed this proposal in a submission to the VFF  explaining that many students must attend private schools due to limited space in public institutions. Supporting both sectors would promote fairness and encourage private investment in education. This proposal is currently included in a draft National Assembly resolution on tuition exemptions and reductions  spearheaded by the Ministry of Education and Training and under review by the Ministry of Justice. It suggests that tuition support for students in private and semi-public schools be equivalent to the maximum rates set for financially non-autonomous public schools by the respective provincial People’s Councils. This morning’s VFF meeting focused on two main agenda items in preparation for the upcoming 9th session of the 15th National Assembly: The first topic concerned legislative dossiers for amending several laws: the Law on the Vietnam Fatherland Front  the Trade Union Law  the Youth Law  and the Law on Grassroots Democracy. These were developed jointly by the VFF  the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour  the Ministry of Home Affairs  and other socio-political organizations. The second topic addressed the draft report summarizing citizen and voter feedback to be presented at the 9th session of the 15th National Assembly. counterfeit products Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Thu Apr 17 14:30:01 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
