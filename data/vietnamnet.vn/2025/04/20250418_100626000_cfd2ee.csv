After the merger  the new Ho Chi Minh City is set to become the most powerful megacity in Vietnam. Photo: Nam Khanh At the 11th Central Committee Conference  the proposal to merge centrally governed cities and provinces was approved. Among the key decisions was the projected unification of Ho Chi Minh City  Binh Duong  and Ba Ria - Vung Tau (BR-VT) into one expanded entity: the new Ho Chi Minh City. Speaking to VietNamNet  architect Ngo Viet Nam Son said that merging these three localities will unlock vast new opportunities and developmental space - though also accompanied by new challenges. In the Southeast region  these three provinces  along with Dong Nai  form the most robust “economic sub-quadrant” in the country  contributing the highest portion to the national budget. Therefore  after the merger  the new Ho Chi Minh City will become one of the most powerful economic growth hubs in Vietnam. Ngo Viet Nam Son emphasized that retaining the name “Ho Chi Minh City” aligns with global development trends  as the city already carries strong international branding. As such  the administrative center will almost certainly remain in Ho Chi Minh City. “Ho Chi Minh City was already the strongest growth engine of the nation. Now  with the addition of Binh Duong and BR-VT  it will become a megacity of exponential strength ” he affirmed. He pointed out that even as the country’s leading city  Ho Chi Minh City currently lacks region-scale infrastructure. For example  the largest airport is in Long Thanh (Dong Nai)  the biggest port is Cai Mep - Thi Vai (BR-VT)  and the main railway station is Song Than (Binh Duong). By merging these areas  the city will gain strategic infrastructure assets - an enormous advantage. Architect Ngo Viet Nam Son.

Key infrastructure systems across the three regions are not yet seamlessly integrated. Post-merger  authorities must revisit urban planning to align with emerging trends. For instance  BR-VT has about 350 kilometers of coastline. Once merged  the new city will be considered a true coastal metropolis. Currently  Ho Chi Minh City is seen as a city with a coastline  but not a coastal city in the full sense - since its coastal area in Can Gio District is a protected biosphere reserve with strict development limits. After the merger  the new Ho Chi Minh City will have greater potential for marine development  including the possibility of extending the metro system down to BR-VT. Regarding Can Gio superport  architect Nam Son suggested re-evaluating its function. Initially  it was planned as a transshipment port to avoid competing with Cai Mep - Thi Vai. But with the port now becoming part of the same urban system  a revised  more integrated strategy is required. He noted that as a megacity  the new Ho Chi Minh City will take on greater responsibilities and more complex socioeconomic dynamics  demanding a fresh mindset and governance approach. “New opportunities and larger developmental space come with greater responsibilities ” Nam Son noted. Development zones based on regional strengths According to Dr. Tran Hoang Ngan  National Assembly member from Ho Chi Minh City  the expanded city will have a population of around 13.6 million - 13.4% of the national population - though its area will account for just about 2%  resulting in a population density of roughly 2 040 people per square kilometer. What’s more  the expanded city contributes a quarter of the national GDP  over a third of state revenue  and one-fifth of Vietnam’s export turnover. “This shows that Ho Chi Minh City  once the economic locomotive of the country  is now even more vital after the expansion ” Dr. Ngan emphasized. He suggested that a special governing framework is needed for this megacity. Specifically  the new Ho Chi Minh City should be divided into smaller zones  each focusing on their distinct advantages. For example  Binh Duong could focus on industrial development through its many concentrated industrial parks. BR-VT would prioritize the marine economy  including logistics  seaport operations  marine tourism  fishing  aquaculture  and oil and gas industries. Ho Chi Minh City would remain the national hub for commerce  finance  banking  healthcare  education  and also lead in science and technology  aligned with Politburo Resolution 57  becoming a center for innovation  digital transformation  and possibly an international financial center. “Such regional zoning will enable the megacity to thrive  eliminating internal competition that existed when they were three separate jurisdictions ” Dr. Ngan explained. To achieve this  he stressed the need for comprehensive infrastructure connectivity - especially prioritizing metro systems that link the city with each zone. All systems go for the merger At the 39th meeting of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee  Party Secretary Nguyen Van Nen confirmed to VietNamNet that preparations for the merger are already complete and just await a formal resolution. He revealed that the Party Secretaries of Ho Chi Minh City  Binh Duong  and BR-VT have met and discussed the merger plan. Government departments  agencies  and local administrations have also proactively taken preparatory steps. A special merger steering committee has been established  and a full interprovincial meeting is expected in April to further discuss the plan’s implementation. “We’ve talked through the necessities and internal matters of each locality. Now we just need one comprehensive meeting between all three provinces to finalize the process. Everything is ready - we’re just waiting for the National Assembly’s official resolution to launch implementation urgently and efficiently  in true ‘run while organizing’ fashion ” Secretary Nguyen Van Nen declared.
