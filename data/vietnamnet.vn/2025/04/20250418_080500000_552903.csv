After graduating from university (under an extension program)  Le Doan Trinh has worked in Xuan Cao commune in Thuong Xuan district  Thanh Hoa province) for nearly 15 years. Trinh serves as a civil servant while also handling the tasks at the commune’s one-stop-shop unit. He spends 50/50 time on each duty  though he’s paid for just one. He said that at university  he could only learn IT in theory  with no practice. In the commune  he was self-taught and gradually picked up skills to meet job needs. Now  he’s among the few officers there confident in IT. Good performers shine anywhere In Xuan Cao commune  many civil servants have to undertake extra tasks beyond their assigned roles. "The commune office workload is always overwhelming. It used to have one staff; now it’s up to two " he said. At work  beyond processing files and assisting locals with administrative procedures  he frequently visits villages to communicate directly with people. Trinh said he and many commune civil servants support the policy on communal unit restructuring  hoping changes will better serve residents. He views scrapping district levels—so people don’t "go in circles" through layers—as the right move. The challenge is balancing staff across levels. On debates about preferring commune civil servants with extension versus full-time degrees  or district versus commune staff  he thinks that district officials  long focused on coordination  generally outpace commune peers in skills and IT. Yet  commune staff excel in grassroots experience and closeness to locals. Blending both could yield top results. "Good performers shine anywhere. But after the commune merger  positions will be arranged according to jobs  each person will do their own job  so there will be people who have difficulty meeting job requirements " Trinh analyzed. "Not all full-time grads outdo non-full-time peers. Some excel through self-study and a learning mindset " he said. He’s always ready to quit per regulations if he can’t meet job demands. "Policies for civil servants exiting during this merger are clear and secure officers’ benefits. In my area  some officers have already opted to retire early " he notes. Correspondence or full-time degrees? Talking to VietNamNet on whether commune civil servants need correspondence or full-time university degrees  former Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Nguyen Tien Dinh said both of them are recognized by the state  and therefore  have equal validity. Assessing civil servants’ competence should hinge on real-world results  testing  and screening. The draft amended Civil Servants Law proposes no distinction between commune  provincial  or central civil servants. Thus  the ex-deputy minister says future screening won’t just target commune staff but also district staff reassigned downward  plus provincial and central levels. Screening criteria can vary by locality. He cites Quang Ninh province  which uses its own tailored set. "Based on legally set general standards  localities will refine them to fit their specific conditions and traits " he said For testing candidates’ capability  he suggests direct interviews or computer-based exams. On IT skills  those lagging must study to improve. Roles needing foreign languages should demand that too. "Then there’s communication  negotiation  advocacy  and persuasion—core skills " he adds. Beyond competence and results  ethics and attitude matter hugely. "Now it’s a constructive  service-oriented state. Serving people with the right spirit is key. Public satisfaction with civil servants is a critical measure " Dinh said. As of December 31  2024  commune civil servants total over 212 600  with 92.4 percent holding university degrees or higher and 7.6 percent with college degrees or below. Thus  only a small fraction fall short of standards  to be handled per government policies  ensuring fair benefits. Many grassroots civil servants hope the restructuring will follow the spirit of "streamlining doesn’t mean elimination " prioritizing young  qualified individuals. The goal isn’t to turn communes into "mini districts" but to build a government tier closer to the people  where resources are managed efficiently  policies roll out fast  and responsibility-shirking ends. This lets localities seize broader development space and craft a long-term vision for sustainable growth. For civil servants  prioritizing young  well-educated individuals with IT skills and standout university records (like joining the Party as students) is a smart path. For semi-specialized staff  consider degrees  real contributions  age  and growth potential for selection or further training.
