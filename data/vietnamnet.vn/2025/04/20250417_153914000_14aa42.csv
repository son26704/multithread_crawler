Under Resolution No. 60 of the 11th Central Committee Meeting  Dak Lak and Phu Yen provinces are expected to merge under the unified name Dak Lak  with the political and administrative center located in the current Dak Lak province. Dak Lak is a mountainous province in the heart of the Central Highlands  with its administrative capital in Buon Ma Thuot City. Phu Yen is a coastal province in the south-central coast  with its government offices based in Tuy Hoa City. As the two provinces prepare to "join under one roof " residents traveling from Dak Lak to Phu Yen will have several travel options. Among these  National Highway 29 stands out as the most direct and strategic route. Dak Lak has recently submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister requesting approval for an investment project to upgrade and improve National Highway 29  with a total projected cost of 10 trillion VND (approx. 400 million USD). This route is considered a vital artery for the movement of goods and services between the two provinces. National Highway 29 is a relatively new route  developed from the former Provincial Road 645 in Phu Yen and Provincial Road 691 in Dak Lak. Currently  it meets Class IV mountain road standards  with two lanes  a 5.4-meter road surface  and a 7.5-meter roadbed. The proposed upgrade would elevate it to a Class III highway with a 20.5-meter-wide roadbed  four lanes  and a design speed of 60–80 km/h. The total length of the route is 182.5 km  running through Dong Hoa town  Tay Hoa  and Song Hinh districts in Phu Yen  and Krong Nang  Ea Kar  and Buon Ho town in Dak Lak. Of this  109 km lies in Phu Yen  and 73.5 km is in Dak Lak. The road begins at Vung Ro Port and ends at the intersection with National Highway 14 in Buon Ho. Notably  it passes through the Ea So Nature Reserve  offering travelers a unique journey from mountain forests to seaside views. From central Buon Ma Thuot  travelers heading to Phu Yen will pass through the ancient forests of Ea So before arriving in Tuy Hoa. The total distance is about 200 km via National Highway 26  with the forest stretch through Ea So measuring 40 km. The route continues through Song Hinh  Tay Hoa  and Dong Hoa before reaching the coast  typically requiring over four hours of travel time. Travelers also have two alternative routes. The first heads from Buon Ho through Krong Nang into Ea So before descending into Phu Yen. The second follows National Highway 26 to Km 62  then through Ea So and Ea Sar communes in Ea Kar District before entering the forest. Interestingly  the distance from Buon Ma Thuot to Tuy Hoa is now comparable to a trip to Nha Trang Beach. To prepare for the administrative merger  Dak Lak is arranging transportation plans for approximately 1 000 officials from Phu Yen who will be relocated for work  with National Highway 29 expected to be the primary route. A merger of strengths: Forest meets sea The proposed merger between Dak Lak and Phu Yen is expected to unlock significant potential for regional integration. It promises to form a major economic hub connecting the Central Highlands and the coast - an ideal combination supported by leaders and residents of both provinces. The union will not only expand the combined economic scale and capacity  enabling more rapid growth  but also create natural synergies: Dak Lak's agricultural strengths will complement Phu Yen’s maritime economy  fostering mutual development. By expanding access to the sea  the merged province can better harness infrastructure  transportation  and logistics potential  promoting stronger trade between the two regions. The merger will also enhance regional connectivity between localities and provinces  facilitating shared development and cooperation. Creating a single province that stretches from highlands to coastline could catalyze sectors like ports  tourism  manufacturing  trade  and services - driving them in a more coordinated direction and avoiding fragmented growth. Furthermore  the consolidation will improve the business environment  attracting investment into emerging sectors including maritime transport  aviation  railways  renewable energy  agroforestry  aquaculture  high-tech industries  digital services  and advanced manufacturing. Lastly  combining the two provinces will bolster national defense capabilities by strengthening strategic depth along both coastal and border fronts - ensuring comprehensive security for the newly merged province.
