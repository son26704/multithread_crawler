On April 17  during its 44th session  the Standing Committee reviewed the draft National Assembly resolution intended to replace Resolution No. 35  which had piloted several special mechanisms and policies for the development of Hai Phong City. Finance Minister Nguyen Van Thang presented a summary of the draft resolution  while Phan Van Mai  Chairman of the Economic and Budgetary Committee  delivered the committee’s assessment report. Several members raised concerns about how the resolution would be implemented in the context of Hai Phong’s anticipated territorial expansion through a merger with Hai Duong Province. Hoang Thanh Tung  Chairman of the Committee on Legal and Judicial Affairs  emphasized that this was not an issue unique to Hai Phong. Other localities such as Ho Chi Minh City  Da Nang  Can Tho  and Khanh Hoa also have their own resolutions on special development mechanisms and policies. Mr. Tung proposed that the Government’s Party Committee report to and seek guidance from the Politburo on the principles for continuing pilot resolutions in provinces and cities that are undergoing mergers and boundary expansions in the near future. National Assembly Vice Chairman Nguyen Khac Dinh stated  “All localities piloting special mechanisms are strong  well-performing provinces. However  the areas being merged in are often weaker.” He supported Mr. Tung’s proposal  stressing that such a move could help reduce wealth gaps and enhance social welfare coverage in the merged regions. National Assembly Chairman Tran Thanh Man noted that if the Politburo approves the proposal before the 9th session of the National Assembly  the legislature could immediately adopt a unified principle for applying special mechanisms to provinces and cities  even after boundary expansion. He also highlighted the importance of streamlining administrative structures  calling it a decisive factor for Hai Phong’s development over the next 10 to 20 years. He urged greater decentralization in line with the Politburo and Party Secretariat’s directive: “Localities make decisions  implement  and take responsibility; while the central government  National Assembly  and Government play facilitating and supervisory roles.” Deputy Prime Minister Ho Duc Phoc welcomed the feedback and pledged to report to the Government on applying special preferential policies to provinces and cities after administrative mergers. He affirmed that if necessary  the Government would seek input from the Politburo. Six major policy groups proposed for Hai Phong’s development According to the draft resolution  the Government has proposed six overarching policy groups comprising 41 specific policies aimed at boosting Hai Phong’s development: Two policies on investment management; four on finance and state budgeting; nine on planning  urban management  natural resources  and the environment; eight on science  technology  and innovation; one on income for officials and public employees under Hai Phong’s administration; and 17 policies related to the establishment and operation of a new-generation Free Trade Zone in Hai Phong. national assembly news Tel: 024 3772 7988 Fax: (024) 37722734 Email: evnn@vietnamnet.vn,Thu Apr 17 14:23:51 ICT 2025,VietNamNet News,en
